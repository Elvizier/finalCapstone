# Task Management System


## Description
The Task Management System is a Python command-line application that allows users to manage their tasks. The system allows users to add new tasks, view all tasks, and view their assigned tasks. Users can also generate reports that show the overall status of tasks in the system.


## Importance
This project is important because it provides a simple and efficient way for users to manage their tasks. It is particularly useful for teams working on projects where tasks need to be assigned, tracked, and completed on time. The Task Management System helps to ensure that tasks are completed on schedule and that team members are aware of the tasks they need to complete.
